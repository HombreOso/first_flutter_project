What the app is for
===============================

It was aimed to be a time boxing app.

After creating an account, user is prompted to specify his interests as "Objective <-> Weekly Time To Spend <-> Importance/Priority" combinations.

The user groups are students of secondary and high schools and universities.

The app should help manage the free time, so this time is not spent on something what does not lead to professionals goals.

One of largests desire of the app's author is to support educational processes in his home country which is at the time of this writing one of the poorest countries in Asia.
